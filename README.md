# Hello!

My name is Kevin and I'm a sophomore studying computer science at Purdue University in West Lafayette. I'm minoring in mathematics and finance, in addition to being a member of the university's interdisciplinary John Martinson Honors College. For the summer of 2025, I'll be working as a Software Development Intern with the AI Business Solutions team at Purdue Federal Credit Union.

In the past, I've interned at Brightworks Group LLC, a technology consulting firm based in Carmel, where I focused on developing automated software to expedite our enterprise clients’ laptop imaging workflow. Aside from my experience in the commercial sector, I'm also actively involved in undergraduate research on campus, spending my most recent academic year with the Wu Research Group working out of Purdue's Discovery Park.

I've worked with a wide range of programming languages, but I'm most confident in Python, JavaScript, and Java. I have a substantial background in full-stack development using technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React. Feel free to check out some of my projects by visiting my portfolio at [kevinqu.com](https://kevinqu.com). Outside of work and school, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, investing, and reading/watching anything sci-fi.
