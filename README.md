# Hello!

My name is Kevin and I'm studying computer science at Purdue University in West Lafayette. I'm minoring in mathematics and finance, in addition to being a member of the university's interdisciplinary John Martinson Honors College. Currently, I'm spending my time learning various concepts within machine learning and relevant libraries like PyTorch.

I'm well-versed in programming, specifically in Python, JavaScript, and Java. I have a substantial background in full-stack development and creating complex modern web applications using an assortment of technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. Feel free to check out some of my projects on my profile or my website (see below).

In the past, I've interned at Brightworks Group LLC, a technology consulting firm based in Carmel. There, I focused on developing enterprise software to expedite our clients' laptop imaging workflow, alongside numerous other projects. I've also participated in competitions like the AFA's CyberPatriot Competition (National Finalist) and the National Cyber Cup (National Champion).
