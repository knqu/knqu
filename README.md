# Hello!

Hello! My name is Kevin and I'm a computer science student at Purdue University in West Lafayette. I'm minoring in mathematics and finance, in addition to being a member of the university's interdisciplinary John Martinson Honors College. My primary interests are full-stack software engineering and machine learning.

I spent this past summer as a Software Development Intern at Purdue Federal Credit Union, where I worked on the Business Solutions team. There, my primary focus was building an AI agent incorporating RAG using Elasticsearch and intelligent MCP tool calling to answer procedural queries related to the credit union and automate repetitive tasks performed by member support staff. Previously, I've also worked as a research intern with the Wu Research Group based out of Purdue's Discovery Park and as a software engineering intern at Brightworks Group.

I've worked with a number of programming languages, but I'm most confident in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java. I have a strong background in full-stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Feel free to check out some of my projects by visiting my portfolio at [kevinqu.com](https://kevinqu.com). Outside of work and school, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, investing, and reading/watching anything sci-fi.
